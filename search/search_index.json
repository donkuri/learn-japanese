It is written in the same vein as this guide and aims to show why this specific approach to language learning is particularly effective and produces real result. Immersion-based learning is deceptively simple and has its roots, at least in the Japanese learning community, in this famous blog. In there, the author realized that by immersing himself constantly in Japanese, he was able to understand the language much faster than by spending time solving grammar exercises in a textbook. The Japanese learning community has evolved a lot in the past few years.</p> <p>My goal in building this website is two-fold:</p> <ol> <li>To explain and argue for immersion-based language learning;</li> <li>To give you an actual learning setup you can use for Japanese.</li> </ol> <p>The first part of this can be found in the main guide, the second in the setup section.

I would also like to thank Marv and Aquafina whose many contributions you can find here and here respectively. These two amazing people spent some of their time to help me get my setup working with their tools.

She has basically three options:</p> <ol> <li>Go to a library near her and look for French textbooks.</li> <li>Sign up to her local French classes.</li> <li>Find a private tutor.</li> </ol> <p>All of the methods above have their pros and cons. For instance, the first method has the advantage of not being too expensive in comparison to the other two, and it doesn't require other people to interact with. The second one is less expensive than getting a tutor, but you still get guidance from an expert (hopefully) who is both skilled at the language and at teaching the language. The third language is the most expensive, but you get exclusive time with a teacher that can focus all their attention on you. Yet, many people go through language-learning classes and never reach fluency. This is true even for school children, some of which genuinely want to learn the language but never go beyond a basic or intermediate grasp of the language. Some people get nowhere at all.</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss this issue by saying that those people are not talented at learning languages, whatever that might mean. But the answer is usually much simpler. The students who end up using the language outside of class are usually those that retain the language. While this is anecdotal evidence, one particularly good example of this is European students whose native language is not English. Those that engage in video games, discuss it on social media (such as Discord or Reddit) and actively engage in those communities tend to have a better grasp of the language than those that simply passively learn the language in school. This should be of surprise to no one, yet it is not clear whether they are learning more in the classroom or on their own.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#the-input-hypothesis","title":"The Input Hypothesis","text":"<p>The core principle behind this guide will be the input hypothesis. We emphasize the following three core tenets of the method:</p> <ol> <li>Input (reading and listening) is more important than output (writing and speaking) for a beginner, and should be the main focus of language learning.</li> <li>It is best to confront material that is only slightly more difficult than one currently knows.</li> <li>Language learning and language acquisition are two separate things, and mastery of the language comes from acquisition first and foremost.</li> </ol> <p>In its original formulation, the input hypothesis theory developed by Stephen Krashen in this paper does not even consider output as important whatsoever. Yet input alone does not lead to proper language production. What this means is that just reading is not enough to be able to write well, but being able to read well is necessary to be able to write well. In other words, input is necessary but not sufficient for proper output.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#language-acquisition-and-language-learning","title":"Language acquisition and language learning","text":"<p>One major point of the theory that needs further explanation is the idea of language acquisition as opposed to language learning. Language learning is the traditional way people learn languages: by studying vocabulary, grammar and syntax. In other words, they are studying the shape of the language, what it looks like, what it sounds like. Language acquisition is the part of language that is concerned with meaning itself, and is developed subconsciously as one starts to interact with the language. The main thesis of the theory is the following:</p> <p>Comprehensible output and language mastery is the result of language acquisition.</p> <p>What this means is that one needs to prioritize getting as much language input as possible, in order to speed up language acquisition which leads to proper mastery of the language, including proper output (talking and writing). In its original formulation, the input hypothesis theory posits that speaking has no effect on language acquisition. This has been debated in the literature. My stance on the topic is that ultimately, comprehensible output does matter, but it is also much harder to come by. If you have a friend who speaks the language you're trying to learn natively, interacting with them in the language seems to have positive effects. Nevertheless, it is not necessary for language acquisition. This explains the first part of the method, input driven.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#immersion","title":"Immersion","text":"<p>The second part of the method is immersion-based. As we saw in the section above, getting a lot of input seems to be the key to learn languages effectively and what better way to get this necessary input than to immerse yourself in the language everyday? This is the idea behind the All Japanese All The Time method. Basically, what the author figured out is that by spending all his time in a Japanese environment, he would be getting input all the time. One way to achieve this is by setting all your appliances in your target language, reading, watching and listening only to content in your target language and using it as much as possible. This is why many people believe that you can't truly learn the language unless you go live in a country that speaks it. But this is not true. You can artificially create immersion. Effectively, you are forcing your brain to consume large amounts of native media in your target language and thus get the input necessary to start acquiring that language. </p> <p>While such a drastic method is not necessarily practical for everybody, the idea behind it is a powerful force that we can harness to quickly get better, at least relative to the traditional textbook methods. Setting your phone in Japanese aside, what we need is large amounts of native material to read, watch and listen. Media recommendations can be found on this page.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#a-japanese-learning-roadmap","title":"A Japanese Learning Roadmap","text":"<p>How then should one go about learning Japanese? There have been multiple guides written discussing this exact issue that you can read in the resources page. The ones I like are this one and that one. If you're not sure whether you want to learn Japanese, maybe this 30 day Japanese learning routine will be for you. In this section, I would like to propose a simple learning roadmap that will take a complete beginner to a place that where they can read anything they want. The roadmap looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Learn the kana.</li> <li>Setup Anki and yomichan.</li> <li>(Optionally) Study kanji in isolation with RRTK450.</li> <li>Learn basic grammar while you go through your first Anki deck.</li> <li>Setup a mining deck.</li> <li>Consume native Japanese content that interests you.</li> <li>(Optionally) Learn to write kanji.</li> <li>Find Japanese natives to talk to and correct your writing.</li> </ol> <p>Notice output (talking and writing) is the very last step of the journey. By far the longest step will be consuming native Japanese content, but it's also the one that should be most fun to you, considering that you're the one choosing what media you consume. Let us break down each of these steps one by one.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#learn-the-kana","title":"Learn the kana","text":"<p>Japanese technically has four main scripts it uses.</p> <ol> <li>Hiragana (\u5e73\u4eee\u540d)</li> <li>Katakana (\u7247\u4eee\u540d)</li> <li>Kanji (\u6f22\u5b57)</li> <li>Romaji (\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57)</li> </ol> <p>Hiragana and katakana are similar to the English alphabet, although instead of representing single letter sounds, they represent two letters sounds like ka and ri. Kanji is what most beginner think of when they see Japanese, these are originally of Chinese origin and are used to describe words, nouns and so on. The last script isn't really a standard script, it is just the English alphabet (the Roman alphabet as the name implies.) The first scripts one learns are the first two as they represent the same sounds and are simple to learn in comparison to kanji. In contrast, you might learn new kanji for a very long time but you should know all hiragana and katakana (collectively called kana). You can learn to write them too if you'd like, but unless you practice often you'll eventually forget how to write them, even if you can tell how to read them.</p> <p>The first thing you should do is read Tae Kim's guide from here to here in order to make sure you actually understand how writing works in Japanese. After this, use this game. Don't forget to add other kana as you learn them using the show/hide options* menu.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#setup-anki-and-yomichan","title":"Setup Anki and yomichan","text":"<p>This section is technical and takes a long time so you can find a detailed explanation on this page. The basic tools we will use are a spaced-repetition system called Anki that will be used to learn and remember things (mostly words, but later on possibly grammar, kanji or other things) and an interactive online look-up dictionary manager called yomichan. Anki uses Anki decks, collections of flashcards to help you remember things, and it is usually those decks that will contain the bulk of our language learning.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#on-the-topic-of-pitch-accent","title":"On the topic of pitch accent","text":"<p>You may or may not know that Japanese is a pitch-based language. This means that words have a different patch associated to them. While it is important, there is no need to stress out over it. Unless you're tone deaf (in which case you can train it a bit at the beginning), we will have pitch accent on the Anki cards we are going to use. Provided you listen enough, you will hear pitch and will be able to replicate it. You shouldn't fail an Anki card just because you did the wrong pitch. Instead, simply re-read the word with correct pitch and move on. I highly suggest you train pitch early on. A wonderful website where you can learn all things pitch accent can be found here. I highly suggest starting by using this tool.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#on-the-topic-of-isolated-kanji-study","title":"On the topic of isolated kanji study","text":"<p>It is not fully clear how useful isolated kanji study is to the development of Japanese mastery. Isolated kanji study refers to the act of studying kanji readings on their own, without studying words directly. Some people have never studied kanji in itself and instead learned words using kanji directly. Some people have started their Japanese journey by using a tool such as Remembering the Kanji or the Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course. I would personally advise against going through the entirety of either books, even in the form of an Anki deck. Instead, I would suggest people skip this step for now and start working through a vocabulary deck, usually Core2.3k. If the vocabulary deck is too hard, it might then be worth using the shortened form of Remembering the Kanji, usually called RRTK450. The deck can be found here.</p> <p>Another useful tool is the kanji map website, which lets you input a kanji character and see it get broken down into radicals, the building blocks of kanji. It also allows you to see if it is used as a building block in other kanji. Learning kanji takes a long amount of time, do not get discouraged if learning Japanese feels very hard in the beginning. A lot of the difficulty in learning a language like Japanese is front-loaded: Once you learn enough words and kanji your reading experience gets much smoother.</p> <p>English speakers are usually discouraged at the fact that one requires learning thousands of kanji to properly read Japanese. But remember:</p> <p>English too requires learning word readings!</p> <p>If you're not convinced, please try to read this poem. In the first four sentences, we see the digraph gh multiple times, and it isn't read the same in every word. Effectively, English also requires learning how written words sound. Tough is not the same as though, yet both words end in ough.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#learning-basic-grammar-and-vocabulary","title":"Learning basic grammar and vocabulary","text":"<p>This step is the first one where you will really get a feel for the language. You can find multiple grammar guides in the resources page, but I suggest using Cure Dolly. Watch until lesson #39, we will be using another grammar resource after this, although you are free to watch more.</p> <p>Do not spend all your time doing grammar exercises!</p> <p>You will not be able to master the language before you get large amounts of input anyway. It is thus inefficient to spend a lot of time trying to master basic grammar before you even start to read! Grammar exercises in particular are of little worth to your overall language learning since acquisition happens because of input, not output. If you have a Japanese friend you can talk with, feel free to do it, but this is very much not necessary. Instead, you should aim to get familiar with grammar and see how it is applied in real Japanese, which you will encounter in the next step. Spend some time writing down what Cure Dolly teaches if you'd like. There is a partial transcript (be careful there are a few mistakes) you can use here. Some people dislike the android-like voice of Cure Dolly or find her speaking a bit too slowly. For those people, I recommend either speeding up the video or reading the transcript.</p> <p>Another legendary grammar guide in the Japanese learning community is Tae Kim's grammar guide. While everything is rather basic and alright for a primer in Japanese grammar, some of his explanations can be confusing. He also seems to misunderstand some basic concepts, specially on the distinction between the \u304c and \u306f particles. The titles of the sections also make it seem like the grammar in Tae Kim is advanced, but everything is pretty basic and you should not expect to have mastered Japanese grammar by the end. Nonetheless, it is still a useful resource. I personally do not recommend it but I know many people like it.</p> <p>The grammar guide I actually like most is imabi. The author understands Japanese grammar extremely well and you can find a lot of information on the website, even for classical Japanese! That being said, the structure isn't perfect and it is definitely not for everyone because it is rather verbose. Still, I suggest you check it out because it actually is worth it. No matter which grammar guide you choose to use, you will have to follow it up with more grammar anyway.</p> <p>Regarding vocabulary, the recommended Anki deck is Core 2.3k. I highly recommend going through a phonetics deck at the same time. Phonetic radicals are the part of kanji that indicate sound and learning them can be very useful to read new, unfamiliar kanji. It is not an exact science most of the time, but it is still worth learning. You can do the phonetics deck before or after Core 2.3k. If Core 2.3k is too difficult for you, I instead suggest going through the Tango N5 and Tango N4 decks which you can find here.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#consuming-native-content","title":"Consuming native content","text":"<p>If you're done with Core2.3k (or well on your way), give yourself a pat on the back. You're not a total beginner anymore. You have some words under your belt even though you still fail a lot of your Anki reviews, and you probably feel like you still don't know any Japanese. That's normal. You haven't really acquired much Japanese yet, but you have learned a good deal. It is now time to start the real journey. This step never technically ends as you will hopefully keep consuming Japanese content as you get better and better at the language. The main aspect of this section is to setup a mining deck. A mining deck is an Anki deck you create yourself using Yomichan on content that you read (or potentially watch with subtitles) where you \"mine\" words from sentences you see in the wild.</p> <p>Creating a mining deck is a topic that deserves a thorough explanation and this task is undertaken on the setup page. I also recommend you start listening to Japanese actively as soon as you can. As said previously, media recommendations can be found on this page. Find a medium you like, be it anime, visual novels or Japanese TV and start listening. Do not be surprised if your ability to listen is wildly inferior to your ability to read at first. When reading you have a written support you can look at any time. Kanji provide some meaning and help you read.</p> <p>At this stage of the journey, it would be useful to consult some more advanced grammar resources. My favorite one is the Dictionary of Japanese Grammar. The way I would study grammar is by doing the following.</p> <ol> <li>Come across a sentence using unfamiliar grammar in your reading.</li> <li>Look up the grammar in this master reference.</li> <li>Note down the grammar item you have encountered in a list somewhere.</li> <li>Review it from time to time.</li> </ol> <p>Another great idea if you are comfortable with Japanese definitions is to do the NihongoKyoshi anki deck you can find here. Other popular grammar resources can be found on the resources page.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#on-the-topic-of-writing","title":"On the topic of writing","text":"<p>Many Japanese learners are surprised to hear that a lot of people do not consider writing kanji physically to be important. In this day and age, most people interact with Japanese online or while speaking, very rarely do they have to write kanji explicitly.</p> <p>If you are interested in learning how to write, I highly recommend reading this guide. The best way to learn how to write in my opinion is to follow the Kanken deck found here. This deck will go up to Kanken level 2, which covers all the so-called \u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57 jouyou kanji, the kanji characters designed as common use by the Japanese Ministry of Education. These kanji characters are usually not the only ones you will see when reading, but knowing how to write all of these is already a tremendous achievement.

Likewise, I recommend you start writing in Japanese (not necessarily physically of course) and have people correct you. This is not to say you cannot start output much earlier, but the bulk of your learning should have been through input. If you do want to produce Japanese, it is good to have a native Japanese partner correct you, because getting good at reading is not enough to get good at writing, and likewise getting good at listening is not enough to get good at speaking. You need to actually produce (what we call output) and work in the language with others.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#whats-next","title":"What's next?","text":"<p>Whatever you want.

You will spend a lot of time on basic grammar patterns. Almost every single sentence you will encounter will have one or multiple new words. This is normal. The key is to trust the process:  The more you read, the easier it becomes.</p> <p>Similarly, the first time you sit down in front of a drama episode, it will probably going to be difficult. People talk fast, the video doesn't necessary help you that much and your ear is not very well-developed yet. As you keep doing it and as you get better at reading, your listening ability will grow as well. Both reading and listening are important skills to have and you should polish them both.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#passive-and-active-listening","title":"Passive and active listening","text":"<p>Passive listening is listening to the language without paying active attention to what you're listening to. It is not entirely clear to what extent passive listening helps you learn languages. It is however pretty clear that active listening does help, however. Active listening requires you to focus on what is being said and to try to properly understand what is going on. You might argue that passive listening can get you better at recognizing the sounds of the language, but many people sing in other languages and their pronunciation is closer to Animal Crossing's Animalese language than to proper pronunciation. You might then argue that input is not output, but at this point we're both confused and not sure what to do so we drop the argument and conclude that you should do passive listening if you like it, but you probably shouldn't expect to get massive listening gains from it.</p>"},{"location":"guide/#how-to-get-a-japanese-routine-going","title":"How to get a Japanese routine going?","text":"<p>I suggest not spending more time on Anki than necessary, and spending the rest of your time studying grammar, reading or listening. Ideally, get progressively more difficult reading and listening materials and keep on grinding. It really is that simple. This is both reassuring and demotivating: There is only one trick, and it works every time, but it requires dedication. The best way to setup a routine is to use (micro)habits, a concept I learned from this book. Start with simple habits and build on them progressively. The goal is to get used to having Japanese as a part of your life, not to burn out learning all the kana in one day just to get to reading faster. If you can that's great, but it's not necessary.

But first, what exactly is Anki?</p>"},{"location":"setup/#anki-a-spaced-repetition-system","title":"Anki, a spaced-repetition system","text":"<p>The idea behind Anki is probably older than the Internet itself. A very popular method to memorize anything is to use physical flashcards. You take a piece of paper, write a question, or more generally a prompt in the front of the card and you write the answer on the back of the card. Put simply, Anki is a virtual library of flashcard decks. It can be used to learn just about anything that requires memorization, \u6697\u8a18 anki being the Japanese term for memorization. This is not only useful to language learners but also to geography enthusiasts and med school students.</p> <p>Unfortunately, vanilla Anki (i.e. Anki without additional plugins or a specialized setup) suffers from a few issues. Those issues are very well documented and you should read this article to see what they are. My favorite Anki setups are this one and that one. In the following, I will try to summarize things for people who don't want to have to read through various guides and want a simple mining setup in the vein of the second guide above, with a few different additions of my own. I do not claim any originality in this setup, it is simply an amalgamation of various resources I have used to create my own setup that I like. With that being said, let's get on with it. This guide is made from the perspective of a Windows user. I have no idea how MacOS works and I cannot help with it. I also use Linux (more specifically EndeavourOS, an Arch-based distro) but I do most of my reviews in Windows on my dualboot setup. Hopefully the guide is still useful to you if you're not using a similar setup!</p>"},{"location":"setup/#installing-anki","title":"Installing Anki","text":"<p>To install Anki, head to the Anki homepage and click on the blue download button. </p> <p>Follow the instructions for your system and make sure you are getting the latest version. There are two possible options to download Anki: qt5 and qt6. At the time of writing, there is an issue with both versions. On qt5, the mining note type we are going to use has a slight furigana spacing issue, although it has a small fix in place to avoid that. On qt6, some addons are not yet fully compatible. I recommend installing the qt6 version for now and seeing if any add-on breaks. The ones we will be installing should not.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#installing-fonts","title":"Installing fonts","text":"<p>I highly suggest you find a set of Japanese fonts that you really like. I personally use the Noto Japanese family of fonts. It is ultimately up to you to decide, but I recommend going for fonts that you won't mind looking at for a long amount of time, because you will. To install them, just right click on them and Install.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#installing-basic-add-ons","title":"Installing basic add-ons","text":"<p>Anki is customizable in two ways: The first one is the settings menu that can be found in the app itself, the second one is additional plug-ins (usually called add-ons) that you can find on Anki's add-on page. The first issue with vanilla Anki is the \"ease problem\" discussed in here. The problem arises when one misses a card repeatedly which lowers the ease factor on that card. Concretely, this means that you will see the card more and more, and on vanilla Anki, the only way to push the ease factor back up is to press \"Easy\". But it is not clear why this distinction is meaningful, and it is not clear either what \"Hard\", \"Good\" or \"Easy\" represent when learning a language. We are going to sidestep the problem entirely by changing the way Anki deals with ease. To do this, we are going to use the following add-ons:</p> <ol> <li>Straight Reward;</li> <li>(Optionally) Pass/Fail.</li> </ol> <p>The first add-on makes it so that hitting \"Hard\", \"Good\" or \"Easy\" is considered a success, and chaining together successes increases the ease factor, thus making you see the card less often (since you keep getting it right, you don't need to see it as much). This makes it easy to fix a bad day where you hit again on the same card multiple times. The second add-on is optional. It removes the \"Hard\" and \"Easy\" buttons entirely, which is more of a matter of taste. Personally, I use it.</p> <p>The next few add-ons are specific to Japanese-learning.</p> <ol> <li>AnkiConnect;</li> <li>AJT Mortician;</li> <li>AJT Japanese;</li> <li>Kanji Grid;</li> <li>Yomichan Forvo Server;</li> <li>Local Audio Server for Yomichan.</li> </ol> <p>AnkiConnect is by far the most important of those, at it allows one to use Yomichan to create cards automatically, more on this in the mining section below.  AJT Mortician is used to deal with cards that you fail consistently during the same review session. This usually indicates that the card is giving you particular trouble, and it might be worth spending some time on it outside of Anki (or in a custom study session) to memorize it. Don't forget to check \"Count from Daystart.\" AJT Japanese will be used to generate furigana readings on words later on when we get to mining. Furigana is basically the spelling of kanji you can write on the kanji to explain to someone who has never read that kanji how to read it. Kanji Grid is a pretty old but reliable add-on that lets you create a grid of kanji, rAnking them based on how well you know them. It is not strictly necessary, but seeing the grid fill up as you learn new kanji is uniquely satisfying. Lastly, Yomichan Forvo Server and Local Audio Server for Yomichan are used to add custom audio from Forvo to Yomichan on your local machine, letting you access audio almost instantaneously and fixing some of the issues with the original audio files in Yomichan (usually coming from JapanesePod101, which has some errors). Simply follow the steps listed on this page to get it up and working.</p> <p>The next add-ons are related to Anki directly and should be useful to everyone using Anki. They are the following:</p> <ol> <li>Review Heatmap;</li> <li>Batch Editing;</li> <li>AutoReorder;</li> <li>Advanced Browser;</li> <li>Edit Field During Review (Cloze);</li> <li>Learning Step and Review Interval Retention;</li> <li>More Overview Stats 2.1;</li> <li>True Retention by Card Maturity Simplified.</li> </ol> <p>Review Heatmap lets you see your progress on the main page of Anki by showing you what days you did Anki and how many reviews you did. Batch Editing, as the name implies, lets you edit entire batches of cards at once. AutoReorder will be used in conjunction with Marv's frequency sorter to allow one to use frequency dictionaries to mine effectively. Advanced Browser enhances the Browse function in Anki. Edit Field During Review lets you edit a card as you're reviewing it. Finally, the last three add-ons give you more detailed statistics in the stats page of the deck you're working on.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#on-the-topic-of-fsrs","title":"On the topic of FSRS","text":"<p>One main way in which this guide departs from the other two I have mentioned in the beginning is in this section. FSRS4Anki is a new custom scheduler for Anki that makes use of modern algorithms to enhance your review experience. I personally suggest all users at least try using this tool after a few months of normal anki. You can find it on this GitHub page with a guide explaining how to use it. FSRS will reschedule cards for you based on your review history. It is also able to do load balancing, which for instance can let you take weekends off if you'd like to do that. There are two ways to use FSRS: with custom settings, or with the default settings. I suggest users to start with the default settings and after one-two months of review data, to use the optimizer found here to get personalized data to optimize their reviewing experience.</p> <p>The main guide to learn how to use FSRS is on this page. Don't forget to install the corresponding add-on. If you would like to know what the algorithm is about, and how things work, you can read the original paper here.

Yomichan is a browser plugin you can use in Firefox or Google Chrome to use Japanese dictionaries while browsing the Internet. This means that you can look up words on the fly simply by hovering over them and pressing a certain keybinding (or none at all). **Sadly, Yomichan is now outdated and needs a new fork. Until a fork has emerged as the successor to Yomichan, I recommend using either the old Yomichan add-on or Yomibaba.

Mining is usually something one does after going through a vocabulary deck like Core2.3k, but some people start a mining deck halfway through Core and it makes your first mining experience much nicer. It is up to you, I recommend going through Core first as it doesn't really take too much time. You can and should start immersing in native content from day one, but it is only after you're well on your way to finishing Core that things will start to make more sense.</p> <p>There are multiple ways to do your mining setup.

Here are a few popular ones: visual novels, (light) novels, (YouTube) videos, Japanese TV, podcasts, music, video games. The best one will be the one you don't mind spending lots of time on. I suggest picking up two at the very least: a reading-based one and a listening-based one. Of all the choices above, my favorite for a beginner is by far visual novels.</p> <p>The reason I prefer visual novels over basically any other kind of medium is due to how complete it is: you get a picture, a complete sentence and voiced audio (usually) at the same time, so it's nice to look at, you are reading and listening at the same time and the progress is easy to track due to the game nature of a visual novel (usually abbreviated VN). One caveat is that most visual novels are for adults due to varying amounts of sexual content in them. Some very popular visual novels have none, and there are all-ages version as well. Overall, visual novels are fun, exciting and great for immersion.</p> <p>This is not to say that other reading materials are bad however, quite the opposite in fact. Ideally, you would expose yourself to a wide variety of Japanese reading, from visual novels to Wikipedia articles to classics and newspaper articles. But if you are going to choose only one thing for your reading needs, I'd make it visual novels (provided you like them). Remember, the most important part is interest, otherwise it will be extremely hard to make reading a habit.</p>"},{"location":"setup/#on-the-topic-of-motivation","title":"On the topic of motivation","text":"<p>There will be days when you just don't want to read. This happens to everyone. Motivation is a powerful drive to start doing things, but it is usually not enough since it can fade away with time. What I suggest is to turn immersion into a routine, something you do everyday without thinking too much about it. The same is true for Anki. After doing it for a few months, Anki fatigue can start to settle in and you will possibly find your time reviewing cards to be quite boring. This is when having a proper routine in place will help tremendously, as you will just do it naturally, in the same way that when faced with a door you have to go through, you don't think for a minute on the right course of action; you simply open the door.</p> <p>To summarize, it is necessary to be very interested your reading materials and to then use that excitement to get into a daily habit of reading.

Then, follow the instructions here and make sure you set up Yomichan accordingly. Everytime you're done with mining for the day, remember to use the AutoReorder add-on to re-order your cards based on frequency. It can also do that automatically on startup which is easier. To make sure it is working, open the config file of the add-on and make sure that the name of the field you are trying to re-order from is \"FrequencySort\", provided you are using Aquafina's mining note as well.
